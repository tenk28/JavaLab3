Abstract Fabrique is a powerful and flexible Java library for creating abstract factories with ease. It provides a straightforward way to implement the Abstract Factory design pattern, allowing you to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Features

- **Easy Abstraction**: Abstract Fabrique simplifies the creation of object families by providing an abstract factory interface and concrete implementations.

- **Configurable**: Customize object creation by implementing the factory interface for your specific use case.

- **Testable**: Improved testability due to the abstraction of object creation, making it easy to mock and substitute objects in your tests.

- **Java 11+ Support**: Built to take advantage of the latest Java features.

- **Open Source**: Abstract Fabrique is open source and available under the MIT License, allowing for flexibility and collaboration.
